The main goal of the poster session at this QuIK workshop is to foster stimulating discussions on this topic in the hope of achieving new collaborations between the attendees. Given this goal, the posters must be designed to interface well with classical information and coding theorists who are interested in learning about these challenges. We highly recommend submitting posters that clearly describe a challenge that can be quickly communicated in a short conversation with an attendee. It is better to refrain from discussing problems that are too deep, technically or otherwise, to understand in a short span of time. The review process for the posters will make this a key criterion for acceptance.</font></h3>

The page limit excludes references. This must not be a summary of a paper but an insightful description of a key problem in quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing that is palatable to a classical information theorist. The submission can be based on published work, but the poster must discuss an unsolved challenge related to that work and not just present the results of that work. After the poster session at the workshop, we encourage the presenters to provide us with the digital version of their posters so that they can be shared on the workshop website for later viewing by any of the attendees.</font></h3>

## Welcome to the first Quantum Information Knowledge (QuIK) workshop, which will be held in Athens, Greece, during ISIT 2024!
### <font color="black"> The Quantum Information Knowledge (QuIK) workshop will be held as part of the <a href="https://2024.ieee-isit.org">IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2024</a>, the flagship conference of the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/">IEEE Information Theory Society</a>. The goal of this first edition of the workshop is to provide foundational knowledge in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), complement that with exciting talks by invited speakers working in this area, foster discussions on key open problems, both foundational and practical ones, and discuss some of the latest results in the field. </font>

### <font color="black"> Please e-mail <a href="mailto:narayananr@arizona.edu?subject=[QuIK]%20Add%20to%20mailing%20list">Narayanan Rengaswamy</a> to be added to the mailing list for this workshop.

## Tentative Schedule:
### <font color="black"> The workshop starts with a tutorial introducing fundamental concepts in QEC and FTQC, targeted at an audience with background in classical coding theory. No prior familiarity with quantum mechanics or quantum computing is assumed. The tutorial will be followed by invited talks by various well-known researchers who are pushing the boundaries of QEC and FTQC. The workshop will end with a panel discussion involving the invited speakers and a poster session based on novel research work and key open problems in FTQC.  </font>

## Topics of the Workshop:
### <font color="black"> The tutorial, presentations, and discussions in this workshop would cover a broad range of research topics in Fault-tolerant Quantum Computation, including but not limited to the following research areas:</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Quantum error correction codes for quantum computing</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Qubit/qudit decoding techniques and their implementation.</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Fault-tolerant quantum computing techniques, including, FT-MBQC, Foliated codes, Floquet codes, etc. </font>
#### <font color="black">*	Fault-tolerant logical gates and logical operator measurements</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Bosonic codes and their decoding techniques</font>
#### <font color="black">*	Fault-tolerance for specific algorithms, including overhead estimates, scaling laws of logical error rates, etc.</font>
<!-- end of the list -->

## Workshop dates:
### <font color="black"> One-day workshop around July 07-12, 2024. The exact date is yet to be decided. </font>

## Invited Speakers List:
### <font color="black"> Invited talks by fault-tolerant quantum computing experts from different backgrounds such as physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, etc., are planned to cater different perspectives of this interdisciplinary field to the audience. The invited speaker list will be announced soon. </font> 

## Call for Papers:
### <font color="black">We invite interested authors to submit their previously unpublished work in the area of fault-tolerant quantum computation, including but not limited to the topics listed above on the website. The paper should be tailored to an audience comprising engineers, mathematicians, and other researchers who are experts in classical coding and information theory. The accessibility of the paper to classical coding and information theorists would be one of the required criteria to accept the paper. The posters should also be accessible to classical coding and information theorists. Take a quantum leap on the coming leap day by submitting your paper by 11:59 PM (anywhere in the world) on February 29th, 2024. </font>

### Paper Submission Details:
#### <font color="black"> Please click <a href="https://2024.ieee-isit.org/information-authors-0">here</a> for the website containing the information for authors such as paper format template and example, etc. Each paper will go through a rigorous review process. An author of an accepted paper has to register and present a poster based on the paper at the workshop. The accepted papers presented as a poster will be published in the IEEE Xplore. Please note that these papers are not eligible for the Jack Keil Wolf ISIT Student Paper Award. </font>

## Call for Posters:
### <font color="black"> We invite the submission of posters primarily concerning major challenges or open problems broadly in quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing, including but not limited to the topics listed above on the website. The main goal of the poster session at this QuIK workshop is to foster stimulating discussions on this topic in the hope of achieving new collaborations between the attendees. Given this goal, the posters must be designed to interface well with classical information and coding theorists who are interested in learning about these challenges. We highly recommend submitting posters that clearly describe a challenge that can be quickly communicated in a short conversation with an attendee. It is better to refrain from discussing problems that are too deep, technically or otherwise, to understand in a short span of time. The review process for the posters will make this a key criterion for acceptance.</font>

### <font color="black">To make your submission for a poster on an open problem, write a 3-page extended abstract describing the challenge and the tentative contents of the poster. The page limit excludes references. This must not be a summary of a paper but an insightful description of a key problem in quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing that is palatable to a classical information theorist. The submission can be based on published work, but the poster must discuss an unsolved challenge related to that work and not just present the results of that work. After the poster session at the workshop, we encourage the presenters to provide us with the digital version of their posters so that they can be shared on the workshop website for later viewing by any of the attendees.</font>

### <font color="black">Each poster will go through a rigorous review process. An author of an accepted poster has to register and present it at the workshop. The accepted posters will not be published on the IEEE Xplore. </font>

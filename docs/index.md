<h3> 
The Quantum Information Knowledge (QuIK) workshop will be held as part of the <a href="https://2024.ieee-isit.org">IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2024</a>, the flagship conference of the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/">IEEE Information Theory Society</a>. The long-term vision for this workshop is to establish a platform at ISIT for active discussions on problems in quantum information. The goal of this first edition of the workshop is to provide foundational knowledge in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), complement that with exciting talks by invited speakers working in this area, foster discussions on key open problems, both foundational and practical ones, and discuss some of the latest results in the field.

	<br>
	
	<font color="#F28C28">Abstract:</font> To effectively address practical imperfections while harnessing the power of quantum information processing, our goal is to design quantum error correction schemes that can not only suppress dominant errors specific to particular hardware but also meet the requirements of various applications. I will discuss the process of designing quantum error-correcting codes that can optimally suppress practically relevant errors, with examples of custom-designed quantum error correction schemes that can efficiently correct practically relevant errors in AMO and solid-state platforms. I will also explore quantum error-correcting codes designed for various applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. <br>

	<font color="#F28C28">Title:</font> On the Decoding Radius of Message Passing Decoders for the Toric Code <br>
	<br>
	
	<font color="#F28C28">Abstract:</font> Kitaev’s toric code is one of the most prominent models for fault-tolerant quantum computation, currently regarded as the leading solution for connectivity constrained quantum technologies. Significant effort has been recently devoted to improving the error correction performance of the toric code under message-passing decoding, a class of low-complexity, iterative decoding algorithms that play a central role in both theory and practice of classical low-density parity-check codes. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of the toric code under min-sum (MS) decoding, a message-passing decoding algorithm known to solve the maximum-likelihood decoding problem in a localized manner, for codes defined by acyclic graphs. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic limitation of the toric code, which confines the propagation of local information during the message-passing process. We show that if the unsatisfied checks of an error syndrome are at distance at least five from each other, then the MS decoding is locally blind: at no iteration, the qubits in the direct neighbor of an unsatisfied check are aware of other unsatisfied checks.  Moreover, we show that degeneracy is not the only cause of decoding failures for errors of weight at least four, that is, the MS non-degenerate decoding radius is equal to 3, for any toric code of  distance at least 7. Finally, complementing our theoretical analysis, we present a pre-processing method of practical relevance. The proposed method, referred to as stabilizer-blowup, has linear complexity and allows correcting all (degenerate) errors of weight up to 3, thus providing quadratic improvement in the logical error rate performance, as compared to MS only. <br>

	<font color="#F28C28">Title:</font> Trapping Sets of QLDPC Codes Under Iterative Decoding <br>
	<br>
	
	<font color="#F28C28">Abstract:</font> Recent developments in quantum hardware technologies have enabled strategic implementation of good quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Unlike classical LDPC codes, the decoding performance of such QLDPC codes under iterative decoding is extremely poor. Using careful analysis of these decoding failures, one can identify the presence of trapping sets – small subgraphs that cause iterative decoding to not converge and result in the decoder error. It is imperative that to improve decoding performance significantly at low-latency constraints, one should enumerate, analyze, and annihilate these trapping sets. From this talk, one will understand what these quantum trapping sets are, where and why iterative decoders such as belief propagation fail for QLDPC codes, as well as how to make them better without using highly complex post-processing steps such as the ordered statistics decoder as the remedy. <br>

	<font color="#F28C28">Title:</font> Tradeoffs between connectivity and codes <br>
	<br>
	
	<font color="#F28C28">Abstract:</font> For quantum error-correcting codes to be realizable, it is important that the qubits subject to the code constraints exhibit some form of limited connectivity. The works of Bravyi & Terhal (BT) and Bravyi, Poulin & Terhal (BPT) established that geometric locality constrains code properties -- for instance \( [[ n,k,d ]] \) quantum codes defined by local checks on the \(D\)-dimensional lattice must obey \( \frac{kd^2}{D−1} \leq O(n) \). Baspin and Krishna studied the more general question of how the connectivity graph associated with a quantum code constrains the code parameters. These trade-offs apply to a richer class of codes compared to the BPT and BT bounds, which only capture geometrically-local codes. We extend and improve this work, establishing a tighter dimension-distance trade-off as a function of the size of separators in the connectivity graph. We also obtain a distance bound that covers all stabilizer codes with a particular separation profile, rather than only LDPC codes. <br>

	<font color="#F28C28">Title:</font> (Some) Logical operations on (some) LDPC codes <br>
	<br>
	
	<font color="#F28C28">Abstract:</font> Error correction codes would be of no use without a method for dynamically manipulating the information they store. While the literature offers several techniques for performing gates on codes with just one logical qubit, there are far fewer solutions available for codes that encode multiple logical qubits. In this paper, we introduce an approach to implement logical encoded gates within hypergraph product codes, even for codes with multiple logical qubits. Our method extends the concept of transversal gates and relies on partitioning the physical qubits within the code in alignment with its logical structure. After demonstrating the fault tolerance of our method, we showcase its application in realizing certain Clifford gates for hypergraph product codes that adhere to specific symmetry constraints. <br>

In this talk, we provide an algebraic characterization for those pairs of binary linear codes that give rise to CSS-T codes and determine the maximal and minimal elements of the poset of CSS-T pairs. We apply these results to find cyclic and extended cyclic codes to obtain quantum codes with better parameters than those in the literature. <br>

## Call for Posters:
<h3> 
We invite the submission of posters primarily concerning major challenges or open problems broadly in QEC for FTQC, including but not limited to the topics listed above for the workshop. The main goal of the poster session at this QuIK workshop is to foster stimulating discussions on this topic in the hope of achieving new collaborations between the attendees. Given this goal, the posters must be designed to interface well with classical information and coding theorists who are interested in learning about these challenges. We highly recommend submitting posters that clearly describe a challenge that can be quickly communicated in a short conversation with an attendee. It is better to refrain from discussing problems that are too deep, technically or otherwise, to understand in a short span of time. The review process for the posters will make this a key criterion for acceptance.<br>
<br>
Each poster will go through a rigorous review process. An author of an accepted poster must register and present it at the workshop. The accepted posters will not be published on IEEE Xplore. But we encourage the presenters to provide us with the digital versions of their posters so that they can be shared with the workshop attendees for later viewing.

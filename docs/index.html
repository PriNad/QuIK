## Welcome to the website of the first Quantum Information Knowledge (QuIK) workshop to be held at Athens, Greece in July 2024
### <font color="black">The main focus of this workshop organized by IEEE ITSOC is to introduce fundamentals of fault-tolerant quantum computation to classical information theorists, invite them to contribute to this wonderful field, and provide a forum for everyone to discuss cutting edge research in fault-tolerant quantum computation. </font>
## Plan for the workshop
### <font color="black"> The technical program consists of the following: TBA </font>
## Workshop dates:
### <font color="black"> TBD (One-day workshop during July 07-12, 2024) </font>
